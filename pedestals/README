- Pedestals are calculated for each grid point of the MIP scan.
- For every single run, only channels that have at least 300 pedestal entries in >10 SCAs are considered for the pedestal calculation.
- After all single analysis are done, the pedestal files are merged in one. Therefore, for several channels it is possible to have duplicated info. The ReadPedestal function in singleSlabAnalysis.cc will select the value of the pedestal (mean/width/error) by choosing the one with lowest error. 

The info in the files is sorted as follows:

#pedestal results (fit to a gaussian) remove channels/sca with two pedestals peaks from the analysis : merged
#chip channel ped0 eped0 widthped0 ped1 eped1 widthped1... ped14 eped14 widhtped14 (all SCA)
