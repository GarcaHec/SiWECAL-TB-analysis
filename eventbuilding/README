Example of running in build.sh

> mergeRootFiles.cc
Merges all 9 files in one (adding one extra dimension to the arrays).
It does also the inversion between high gain and tdc if this is the case.
It also makes the bcid-offset correction between fev13s and slbs

To do: what about the auto gain ? This bit is not included in the standard RAW2ROOT output, so I did not used it here.


> build_events.py
It uses the output from the previous macro and applies, for the moment,

dummy pedestal + masked channels + mip calibration
Time Event building (+-3 bcids)
