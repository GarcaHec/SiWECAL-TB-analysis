- Pedestals are calculated for each grid point of the MIP scan.(see ../pedestal/README file)
- MIPS are calculated slab by slab, not doing any event building (i.e. not using tracks)

The information in the file is sorted as follows:

#mip results dif_1_X_X
#chip channel mpv empv widthmpv chi2ndf nentries
